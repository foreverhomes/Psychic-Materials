            <h2>POST (in progress).</h2>
            <p>By Casey Mecija</p>

            <p><strong>January 26th, 2018 at 11:15pm:</strong> <br />
            My water breaks – like someone snapping their fingers inside of my body. <br />
            Water rushes down my leg - it doesn’t stop.</p>

            <p><strong>January 27th, 2018 at 12:49pm: </strong><br />
            Asa Cy Dyer-Mecija is born. He weighs 8 lbs. and 6 oz. I quietly acknowledge his arrival. </p>

            <p>The body will split and the poem will scatter.<br />
            When memory disappoints, when it weeps for repetition, sound will heal the dismembered.<br />
            When you read these words listen for my loving.<br />
            When you hear these sounds know the world is of your making (the most excruciating joy).</p>

            <p>The flesh contains the scene.<br />
            Our past floats in amniotic speakers.<br />
            I tell you I love you. I push this love into the future.<br />
            I am your first failure. You are my first best try.<br />
            When the world arrived it begged to be taken somewhere else.<br />
            You are that somewhere else.</p>

            <p><strong>April 4th, 2018</strong><br />
            You are the pivot, a new way of knowing.<br />
            There are moves we’ve made but cannot show.<br />
            This love goes nowhere, unrevealing and against our will.<br />
            <strong>THERE IS SO MUCH HERE.</strong><br />
            A quiet room, my energy is self-destroying.<br />
            The deprivations are incandescent.<br />
            The loneliness veiled in self-discipline.<br />
            I am listening to the future.<br />
            I witness its humming in a strange body.<br />
            My hips are made of fire.</p>

            <p><strong>April 5th, 2018</strong><br />
            knotted knees<br />
            the future pulls a knife<br />
            a rusted tongue that offers animal sounds</p>

            <p>we can never be too lonely<br />
            the night reluctantly budges<br />
            with didactic eyes<br />
            his hair was shining<br />
            I follow the fantasy<br />
            where the sea is motionless, bottomless and scary</p>

            <p>my childhood is hard to remember<br />
            sleep walking where my desires are overgrown<br />
            your childhood is still unfolding</p>

            <p>keep it private, keep it yours<br />
            where sun kicks the surf <br />
            let your heart hold its heat and feel the wind</p>

            <p><strong>April 10th, 2018</strong><br />
            Drained body; the night moves slowly, so slowly.<br />
            I went inside myself and waited for the sound.<br />
            What do I pass down?<br />
            He is only sound. <br />
            The sound of wanting, craving, awaking, shitting, discovering,<br />
            coming into focus.<br />
            I listen for these sounds.<br />
            They keep my blood flowing.<br />
            I am afraid of this sonic dependency.<br />
            This is a new love, strange, seductive and unfolding.<br />
            I’m stranded on these/by these sounds.<br />
            A new world where the feeling of familiarity slips through my fingers.<br />
            A new language buzzes in our apartment.<br />
            Did we build this? Did we construct these syllables into meaning?<br />
            Its persisting abstraction reaching towards an uncertain future.<br />
            I’m getting to know you and your stubborn innocence.<br />
            My fatigue feels like infinity.<br />
            My otherness is not yet known.<br />
            A still life in monochrome.<br />
            The truth is a destructible house.<br />
            I no longer know the words to pull my senses back in line.<br />
            Beauty and bravery are intimately co-present.<br />
            Blood on the floor and my eyes remain closed.<br />
            My life now departing to become something new.<br />
            We are making love easy, I think.<br />
            Calibrating gentle devices while<br />
            the poem rises and falls with your skin.</p>

            <p><strong>April 28th, 2018</strong><br />
            the yes pushes into the future<br />
            We tell our stories despite rust and gutted dissidence.<br />
            We insist that this is the place where hope and sentimentality<br />
            accommodate patience; a nervy collusion with all kinds of ignorance.<br />
            When the icy fog recedes you are there, fencing with words and trembling with frustration.<br />
            We know that we need more space.<br />
            These concrete walls partition our desire.<br />
            We know we need a door to keep the baby sleeping.<br />
            Sometimes the child leans towards our warmth.<br />
            It is our job to keep his world simmering.<br />
            Yes, yes, yes.</p>

            <p><strong>May 22nd, 2018</strong><br />
            <p>Sleeping with the sun is a revolutionary feat.<br />
            The serrated light pulls but we must learn when to produce dreams.<br />
            Little by little it becomes clearer.<br />
            The tenacity of affect seeks out guidance; it needs discipline and consistency.<br />
            I am the skeleton that your body needs to be contained by.<br />
            Everything I know is the archway for you to pass under.<br />
            We share an intimacy that makes me tremble.<br />
            Your happiness relies on this sleep.<br />
            Let me compose a method for your disappearance.<br />
            In dreams, somewhere far away sheets of water hold you like I first held you.</p>

            <p><strong>June 1st, 2018</strong><br />
            I can find another story to conjure the feeling of<br />
            that arched back and those ascendant lips.<br />
            I return to the fleshy debris, which begets an optimistic outlook on life, on us and on you.<br />
            Here is how the dream goes:<br />
            the poem will arrive to us vacant.<br />
            We spend mornings in bed populating its lines with stories of our bodies; something like an affective encounter with warm wind.<br />
            This air blows on us until we are transparent and maybe innocent?<br />
            We haven’t touched in months.<br />
            The world got small somehow.</p>

            <p><strong>June 4th, 2018</strong><br />
            My mind is stuck in London.<br />
            I felt stronger then. <br />
            Gnashing concrete, wasting the day, following pleasure and unmaking the clock.<br />
            A dripping moon and an empty cup.<br />
            I felt freer then.<br />
            A life yet excavated.<br />
            Translucent imaginations.<br />
            Learning from the city and willing to be taught.<br />
            I crossed the street to the corner store, bought a can of beer<br />
            and never felt more alone.</p>

            <p><strong>June 8th, 2018</strong><br />
            Subversive frame in<br />
            ochre, magenta and gold.<br />
            Am I inside or do you take up all of the space?</p>

            <p><strong>June 9th, 2018</strong><br />
            I don’t want to reduce this; we can’t be so simple.<br />
            The inscription becomes clearer.<br />
            Your body signifies a shared language.<br />
            A poem that can’t be torn up. <br />
            Shelves full of books between your thighs; the balance of life.<br />
            If we could recalibrate the world and mine it for its whiteness;<br />
            if we could cauterize the nosebleeds and distill performances of knowing;<br />
            if we could insist and plead that the poem begins here then what becomes of us?<br />
            Swept by configurations of kinship changed of course when we begin speaking.<br />
            The clarity of limits and a genealogy of eyelids revealed itself.<br />
            What do we do with the deadly silence of loneliness?<br />
            We plan for whatever we can and cling to life in a possessive manner.</p>

            <p><strong>June 10th, 2018</strong><br />
            You are a sharp presence.<br />
            You are a name that punctures.<br />
            I whisper your name; repeat it until it soothes me.<br />
            You were born in a bed with a mattress and box spring stacked too high.<br />
            I had to climb onto that bed like it was a cavalry horse.<br />
            I kept my eyes closed because the pain was a fire burning me from the inside.<br />
            I’m setting the scene; allowing myself to lean into these imperceptible forms of perseverance. <br />
            I did it.<br />
            With biological tracings in the kitchen and<br />
            the sound of your pathway echoing through out our building.<br />
            I was unstitching space for you to occupy.<br />
            Family is a feeling of perseverance.<br />
            Queer family is bittersweet survival.</p>

            <p><strong>June 13th, 2018</strong><br />
            I push my memories through a sieve.<br />
            I struggle through perforated conversations.<br />
            A rustling of paper and a moment without speaking.<br />
            I fear my writing is boring.<br />
            I’ve become distant and dishonest.<br />
            Stretching feelings across mundane addresses.<br />
            I remember my first childhood home.<br />
            The façade was painted black and white. <br />
            I sat on a rock wearing a helmet aware of the impending danger of social life.<br />
            I should just be more honest even though I was afraid of honesty as a child.<br />
            The fear had me hiding in a plywood box on a constructions site.<br />
            My mother found me sitting on a ragged sample of carpet and eating Danish butter cookies.<br />
            She grabbed my ear and dragged me home.<br />
            I didn’t feel ashamed or regretful.<br />
            My queerness was the worst thing I could do.<br />
            It was the deepest shame. <br />
            An infinite no.</p>

            <p><strong>June 25th, 2018</strong><br />
            I’m learning to love you.<br />
            We shared a restless breath blistered in the heat of the summer.<br />
            Sprung like cats eager to be alone.<br />
            I could look at you forever, a canvas made from me, outside and separate.<br />
            But I remember when we were the same.<br />
            I convinced you of this illusion.<br />
            The old silences became the buzzing from the floor below.<br />
            Let me be the canopy.<br />
            Let me be your crimson dreams.<br />
            Let me be translation.<br />
            The sky folds into the dusty neighborhood.<br />
            The syllables from your name dot the street.<br />
            Your smile is blushing with meaning.<br />
            My splintered youth, grey hairs and veins of iron remind me that I’ve<br />
            loosened to this unfamiliar tune.<br />
            A melody that begs to be discerned, improvised at every turn.<br />
            Let me be a warm enclosure where the pain of difference rests within my devoted arms.<br />
            Let me expose the universe; prepare you for its boiling altercations and its best intentions.<br />
            In time, the poem will reveal how I’ve tried to cram words into a gaping darkness,<br />
            a heart sickness, a memory of the world I’ve promised you.</p>

            <p><strong>July 6th, 2018</strong><br />
            My rectum is coming out of my ass (I think).<br />
            My pelvis is having a difficult time holding my organs.<br />
            My bladder never empties.<br />
            I pushed you out of my body and all of the support for my insides left with you.</p>

            <p>The thunder rattles our windows.<br />
            You’ve finally fallen asleep despite your rowdy resistance.<br />
            You’re becoming aware of the distance between objects. <br />
            When I leave you to sleep perhaps you think I won’t return.</p>

            <p>I’m daydreaming of our new home.<br />
            There is space for you to play, <br />
            a chair to hold you in and a room for you to feel alone in.<br />
            I mourn for the past while allowing this primordial affection for you guide me into an uncertain future. <br />
            You can have my body.<br />
            Let it be uncanny and familiar.<br />
            This wound became your world.<br />
            The pain was merciless, a betrayal I was not prepared for.</p>

            <p><strong>July 13th, 2018</strong><br />
            My therapist says I’m vague. I circle around puncture points. My poems are also vague.<br />
            Adjectives suffused with feelings and memories too painful to clarify with any evidence or detailed recollection. I’m doing it now. I told my therapist that I often fantasize about getting into a car and driving away. I told my therapist that I often lose myself when I’m performing; <i>to be alone inside the lyrics of a song or the notes of a melody; to be alone in a moving car.</i></p>
